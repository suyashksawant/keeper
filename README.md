# Keeper App
This is a simple clone/imitation of Google Keep made with React from Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp. It uses React Hooks, state, props, and array mapping to allow for the creation and deletion of notes.

Keeper uses Material-UI components and icons, and this background image from transparenttextures.com.

Happy note taking!
